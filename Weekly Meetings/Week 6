Discussion: 
- We have met later on during the week due to extra curriclular activities.
- Since our last meeting, the Use Case diagrams and the activity diagrams have been completed.
- Were moving onto task 4, starting to design the individual architectual design for our subsystems. 
- We arent exactly exactly sure if were on the right track with task 4, and so were all going to attend the coming lecture.
- We're lacking information. 
- We're hoping that the lecture clears things up on the current models we have created for the 4th task.

Agenda for week 7:
- Begin our individual architectural designs and once all of us have finished our individual sections, we'll then move onto the group design.
- Start brainstroming ideas for task 5.
