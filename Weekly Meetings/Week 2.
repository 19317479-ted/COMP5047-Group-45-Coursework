Agenda discussed last week: 
Ideally everyone in the group has created a document for the functional requirement. We will then compare, discuss and improve our individual one from there. - Just start and get something down on a document.
From that point, we would like to finalize further dates outside of practicals in order to meet up and progress. 

Meeting and discussion:

Before we reach the agenda. We discussed the fact that we misinterpreted the assignment and mixed up the practical task from week one with the actual course work. We are going to rediscuss and allocate new roles and user types, and then attent to the agenda for the meeting.

User Types:
Ted - Student Union Management System
Arian - USU Operation System
Jayden - USU Operation System
Kai - MIA

Attendances: Arian, Ted, Jayden.
Note: We have reached out to Kai Goodman multiple time however we have received no response from him or attempt to get involved. We will continue to reach out however if not contact or effort is made from him, then we will not be able to include him in the project.

Attending to the agenda:

Finalizing dates to meet: Every Wednesday at 13:00 on the platform(Flexible as two member commute to and from Uni.)
Due to out misunderstanding in week one, we will delay the first draftas for the quality requirements document to week three to be ready for Tuesday.  
We also attached all necessary documents to our github to have in one place as well as created a document highlighting each task of the coursework. 

Agenda for 07/10/2025:

Arrive with draft and discuss each one to make sure that they compliment and comply with eachother as required in the course work. 
Touching on the next phase.
Learn how to use papyrus for UML diagrams for documentations.
