Location: The Platform JHB

Discussion:
- After a discussion with Huong Zuo, we realised that for the use case diagram, theres only meant to be one actor maximum, aswell as more detailed use cases.
- For the activity diagram we realised theres only meant to be two swim lanes, and in between the control flows there has to be buffers for the data. Showing the data moving and leaving between swimlanes.
- Due to this discussion, All three of us have minor changes to get closer to the mark schemes expectation for the diagrams.
- However being lead more into the direction of the markscheme is extremely helpful to get as close as the expectations for the module.

Agenda for week 8:
- Begin reworking diagrams using advice from Huong Zuo.
- Start working towards task 5.
- Meeting date for week 8 11/11/2025
